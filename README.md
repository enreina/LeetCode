# LeetCode
This is a collection of my solution to LeetCode problems as part of my journey on getting back into programming after ~1 year hiatus as part of a career break. 

It's automatically curated from LeetCode by using the chrome extension [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) -- check out their repo, it's awesome!

## Study Plan
The problems I've been working on are part of [LeetCode Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/), specifically the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/]. I've completed the Level 1 problems, and now currently working on the Level 2 problems.

## About my solutions
For now I try to aim on just getting an accepted submissions on LeetCode -- and just when I feel like it I'll try to optimize it as best as I can. My solutions are not the best (better solutions are available on LeetCode Discussions forum). When the time is right (i.e. I feel like it), I'll try to revisit my solutions in the future for optimizations.

The problem-solving approach I've applied to each problem should be mostly written on the source code itself as comments (first few lines). But if anyone has any question or up to any discussion -- feel free to send me a message.

## Daily Notes
There is also an accompanying daily notes (consisting of references I used when working on a solution, especially on reviewing Javascript API). It's available [here](https://aback-casquette-46c.notion.site/LeetCode-Grind-Study-Plans-483a6587290a4ce98136f0b4a5bec802).
